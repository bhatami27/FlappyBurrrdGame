Assignment01 Evaluation:

Our Assignment01 submission met the following requirements:
	1. Follows the MVC Pattern
	2. Incorporated all required UI elements
	3. Make substantial use of:
		. SpriteKit (the basis of the game)
		. CoreData (used to persist user scores)

Upon reviewing our design documents from Assignment01, it appears we were mostly correct in our expectations of our app, but some things were wrong.
In particular, we did not foresee that the game screen and home screen would be simpler to implement as a single view with SpriteKit. Consequently, we
needed to make another view to meet project requirements. The new view (and funcationality!) we decided to implement was a screen for selecting your
character. Previously, you could only play as the default character, now we will let the user choose how they want to look in game. Despite this fairly significant
change, the bulk of our design documents are still accurate and have been implemented (to the extent required) as planned.

App Evaluation:

Our app is well under way. The core features are in place and mostly functional. The game can be played and all necessary views can be accessed, although
they don't all work. The high score screen is in place, but the UI needs a little polishing and use of CoreData needs to be finalized. Our character selection
screen is accessable has all necessary UI elements (although, once again, not entirely functional yet). This implementation has largely followed the design
we set out with from Assignment01 and we have met all necessary requirements for Assignment02.
