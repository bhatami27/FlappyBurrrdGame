C323 Assignment 1
Flappy Burrd
04/20/2021

Our app will be a recreation of the famous "Flappy Bird" mobile game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird).
Our app will contain the same style of gameplay wherein a bird character is moving rightward at a constant speed towards a never
ending series of obstacles. The user's goal is to tap the screen to flap the bird's wings in order to guide the bird through
the obstacles without hitting thme. Once the bird hits an obstacle, the game ends and the users score is recorded. The app will
also persist the user's previous scores which can be viewed by the user in the "High Scores" screen.

The App will meet the project requirements in the following ways:
	1: 
	MVC: We will follow the MVC architecture.
	
	2: 
	Input: Buttons (UIButton and as part of a Tab Bar Controller) to navigate the app, touch controls to play the game
	Output: Text to prompt action from the users, Graphical display of game, table view to display high scores
	Views: Home screen, Game view, High scores screen (Table View Controller)
		. These views will be organized within a Tab Bar Conroller.
	
	3: 
	Our app is different than any of the apps done in class.
	
	4: 
	Our app will incorporate a UI (as described previously) and persistent local data storage (Core Data).
	
	5: 
	Our app will use the Core Data framework to persist the user's scores.
	
	6:
	Our app will use the SpriteKit to handle graphics.
